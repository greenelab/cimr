*****************************************************


**Date:** |today| **Version:** |version|


`cimr <https://github.com/greenelab/cimr>`_ is an open source, BSD-licensed
library providing data analysis tool for the `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_
programming language. cimr primarily utilizes publicly available summary
statistics files from genome-wide association study (GWAS), expression quantitative
trait loci (eQTL) or other variant-based association mapping results.
For contributing new data into cimr-d, see
`contributions document <https://github.com/greenelab/cimr-d/blob/master/doc/contributing.md>`_ .
cimr also offers some utility functions to process variant-based association
summary statistics and to conduct gene-based tests.
